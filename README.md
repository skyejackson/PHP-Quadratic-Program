# PHP-Quadratic-Program
Write a PHP program to solve  quadratic equations.  Ask the user for A, B, C.(AX2 + BX + C). 

 Find both roots; indicate if they are the same; discover how to deal with complex roots.  

Place in a loop to run 5 times with different user inputs.  

Remember:  X = ( -B +/- sqrt(B^2 - 4AC))/ 2A
